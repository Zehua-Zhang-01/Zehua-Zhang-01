I am a data scientist with a particular interest in analyzing geospatial data 🌏 of any research field (agriculture, urban sustainability, infrastructure assessment, environmental modelling, etc). As a lazy guy, I am always looking for some shortcuts to bypass unnecessary coding, haha. 

In this page, you will find some codes for my published research works: Robust geographical (interaction) detector, Geocomplexity, and so on. Hope there will be more demo here in the future. I will be constantly delivering some tips on 'GGPlot2' for making scientific research figures at the publication level. 

Bachelor of Science (Mathematics) (Shanghai University - 2018); Master of Information Technology (Unimelb - 2020); PhD (Curtin University - 2023)

Apart from the research, I also love - 

Gym 💪 Biking 🚴‍♂️ Cooking 🥘 Sleeping 💤 and Movies 📽

If you love geospatial datasets as well, I am looking forward to seeing you anyplace anytime!
